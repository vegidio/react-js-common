# React JS Common

In this project I keep the list of most packages and helper classes that I commonly use during the development of my React JS apps. This project will be updated constantly as I find better libraries to do the tasks or when I improve code in one of my classes.

## Architecture

This project uses of the [MVVM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modelâ€“viewâ€“viewmodel) pattern and makes de binding between the Views and the ViewModels through reactive programming, with [MobX](https://mobx.js.org).

## Packages

I used a set of well-known Javascript packages so we don't have to reinvent the wheel ðŸ™ƒ

* __eslint:__ linting tool for Javascript.
* __mobx:__ to make use of functional reactive programming.
* __react-router:__ router solution for Reach JS.
* __semantic-ui-react:__ commonly used UI elements.

## Build

To build the project you need Node.js. In the project root folder type:

```
$ yarn build
```
